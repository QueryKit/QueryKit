# QueryKit

QueryKit, a simple type-safe Core Data query language.

## Usage

To get the most out of QueryKit, and to get full type-safe queries, you may
add extensions for your Core Data models providing properties which describe
your models. You may use [querykit-cli](https://github.com/QueryKit/querykit-cli)
to generate these automatically.

An extension for our a `Person` model might look as follows:

```swift
extension User {
  static var name:Attribute<String> { return Attribute("name") }
  static var age:Attribute<Int> { return Attribute("age") }
}
```

This provides static properties on our User model which represent each property
on our Core Data model, these may be used to construct predicates and sort
descriptors with compile time safety, without stringly typing them
into your application.

```swift
let namePredicate = Person.name == "Kyle"
let agePredicate = Person.age > 25
let ageSortDescriptor = Person.age.descending()
```

### QuerySet

A QuerySet represents a collection of objects from your Core Data Store.
It may have zero, one or many filters. Filters narrow down the query
results based on the given parameters.

#### Retrieving all objects

```swift
let queryset = Person.queryset(context)
```

#### Retrieving specific objects with filters

You may filter a QuerySet using the `filter` and `exclude` methods, which
accept a closure passing the model type allowing you to access the
type-safe attributes.

The `filter` and `exclude` methods return brand new QuerySet's including your filter.

```swift
queryset.filter { $0.name == "Kyle" }
queryset.exclude { $0.age > 25 }
```

You may also use standard `NSPredicate` if you want to construct complicated
queries or do not wish to use the type-safe properties.

```swift
queryset.filter(NSPredicate(format: "name == '%@'", "Kyle"))
queryset.exclude(NSPredicate(format: "age > 25"))
```

##### Chaining filters

The result of refining a QuerySet is itself a QuerySet, so it’s possible
to chain refinements together. For example:

```swift
queryset.filter { $0.name == "Kyle" }
       .exclude { $0.age < 25 }
        .filter { $0.isEmployed }
```

Each time you refine a QuerySet, you get a brand-new QuerySet that is in
no way bound to the previous QuerySet. Each refinement creates a separate
and distinct QuerySet that may be stored, used and reused.

#### QuerySets are lazy

A QuerySet is lazy, creating a QuerySet doesn’t involve querying
Core Data. QueryKit won’t actually execute the query until the
QuerySet is *evaluated*.

#### Ordering

You may order a QuerySet's results by using the `orderBy` function which
accepts a closure passing the model type, and expects a sort descriptor in
return.

```swift
queryset.orderBy { $0.name.ascending() }
```

You may also pass in an `NSSortDescriptor` if you would rather.

```swift
queryset.orderBy(Person.name.ascending())
queryset.orderBy(NSSortDescriptor(key: "name", ascending: true))
```

#### Slicing

Using slicing, a QuerySet's results may be limited to a specified range. For
example, to get the first 5 items in our QuerySet:

```swift
queryset[0..5]
```

**NOTE**: *Remember, QuerySets are lazily evaluated. Slicing doesn’t evaluate the query.*

#### Fetching

##### Multiple objects

You may convert a QuerySet to an array using the `array()` function. For example:

```swift
for person in try! queryset.array() {
  println("Hello \(person.name).")
}
```

##### First object

```swift
let kyle = try? queryset.first()
```

##### Last object

```swift
let kyle = try? queryset.last()
```

##### Object at index

```swift
let katie = try? queryset.object(3)
```

##### Count

```swift
let numberOfPeople = try? queryset.count()
```

##### Deleting

This method immediately deletes the objects in your queryset and returns a
count or an error if the operation failed.

```swift
let deleted = try? queryset.delete()
```

#### Attribute

The `Attribute` is a generic structure for creating predicates in a
type-safe manner as shown at the start of the README.

```swift
let name = Attribute<String>("name")
let age = Attribute<Int>("age")
```

##### Operators

QueryKit provides custom operator functions allowing you to create predicates.

```swift
// Name is equal to Kyle
name == "Kyle"

// Name is either equal to Kyle or Katie
name << ["Kyle", "Katie"]

// Age is equal to 27
age == 27

// Age is more than or equal to 25
age >= 25

// Age is within the range 22 to 30.
age << (22...30)
```

The following types of comparisons are supported using Attribute:

| Comparison | Meaning |
| ------- |:--------:|
| == | x equals y |
| != | x is not equal to y |
| < | x is less than y |
| <= | x is less than or equal to y |
| > | x is more than y |
| >= | x is more than or equal to y |
| ~= | x is like y |
| ~= | x is like y |
| << | x IN y, where y is an array |
| << | x BETWEEN y, where y is a range |

##### Predicate extensions

QueryKit provides the `!`, `&&` and `||` operators for joining multiple predicates together.

```swift
// Persons name is Kyle or Katie
Person.name == "Kyle" || Person.name == "Katie"

// Persons age is more than 25 and their name is Kyle
Person.age >= 25 && Person.name == "Kyle"

// Persons name is not Kyle
!(Person.name == "Kyle")
```

## Installation

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is the recommended way to add QueryKit to
your project, you may also use Carthage.

```ruby
pod 'QueryKit'
```
